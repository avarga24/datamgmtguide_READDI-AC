These credentials are an Access Key ID and a Secret Acess  Key. You may request these either by direct messaging Yaphet Kebede through our PROTO-OKN Slack channel or by emailing Yaphet at kebedey at renci dot org.</p> Warning <p>We are currently trying to resolve a problem with extremely large files (e.g., 100GB or more).
