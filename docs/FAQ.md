### Q: What are protocols?  
**A:** Protocols in CDD Vault are structured frameworks that guide the data collection process during experiments. They detail experimental conditions, measurements, and data analysis methods, ensuring consistency and reliability across research activities. For the READDI-AC project, protocols are organized within a specific project space, aligning with lab and assay names to facilitate structured data management. 

There are four main types of protocols in READDI-AC, each tailored to different study requirements: 

1. Cell-based assays: Evaluate biological responses in live cells, providing insights into substance effects on cell function and viability. 

2. Target-based assays: Investigate interactions between drug candidates and biological targets to determine modulation effects, essential for drug discovery. 

3. Animal studies (in vivo): Assess therapeutic candidates' biological and pharmacological effects in animal models, offering efficacy and safety data. 

4. Physicochemical properties assays: Analyze substances' physical and chemical characteristics, crucial for drug development and optimization.

### Q: What are readouts?  
**A:** To better explain readouts, [this diagram](cddvault.md/#understanding-readouts) provides guidance on understanding CDD Vault’s foundational structure to systematize and manage your experimental data. This includes defining readouts, which represent various result types. Readouts are essential elements that categorize and define different types of experimental results.

### Q: How do I search for data associated with a specific protocol?  
**A:** In the CDD Vault, the search feature provides a powerful tool to locate data associated with a specific protocol efficiently. Here's how you can leverage this feature to streamline your data retrieval process: 

- Initiating a Search: Access the search feature within the CDD Vault. You can begin by entering relevant keywords, protocol names, or other identifiers related to the data you are seeking. 

- Refining Your Search: Utilize the available filters to narrow down your search results. You can specify the type of data, the date range, or other relevant criteria to focus your search on the exact data associated with the protocol of interest. 

- [Saving Your Search](https://support.collaborativedrug.com/hc/en-us/articles/214358583-Saved-Search): Once you have defined and executed your search, CDD Vault offers an option to save it for future use. By saving your search, you can quickly revisit and update it as needed, without the necessity to redefine the parameters each time. 

- Accessing Saved Searches: Your saved searches can be easily accessed from your dashboard or search menu, allowing efficient data retrieval when referencing specific protocol-related data. 

- Exporting Protocol Data: If you need to export data related to a specific protocol, CDD Vault provides comprehensive instructions in their knowledge base, which can be accessed via this link: [Export Protocol Data Instructions](https://support.collaborativedrug.com/hc/en-us/articles/214358943-Export-Protocol-Data). 

By following these steps, you can effectively search for, retrieve, and manage data associated with specific protocols within the CDD Vault, enhancing your research efficiency and data organization. 

### Q: How do I see which other data is associated with these molecules  
**A:** To discover and view various data points related to specific molecules within the CDD Vault, you can customize your search results table to include relevant data fields. Here's a step-by-step guide based on the instructions found in the CDD Vault knowledge base: 

- Initiate a Search: Start by performing a search in the CDD Vault to locate the molecules of interest. You can use keywords, molecular identifiers, or other relevant criteria to find the molecules. 

- Customize Search Results Table: Once you have your search results, you can customize the results table to display additional data associated with these molecules. Click on the 'Customize' button typically located above the search results. 

- Select Data Fields: In the customization menu, you will find a list of available data fields that can be added to your results table. These fields may include assay results, annotations, chemical properties, or any other data stored in the CDD Vault related to the molecules. 

- Apply Customization: After selecting the desired data fields, apply the changes to update your search results table. The table will now display the additional data associated with the molecules you searched for, providing a comprehensive view of all relevant information. 

- Save and Export: If needed, you can save your customized view for future reference or export the data for further analysis outside of the CDD Vault. 

For detailed instructions and additional information on customizing your search results table, you can refer to this guide: [Customize the Search Results Table](https://support.collaborativedrug.com/hc/en-us/articles/214358523-How-can-I-customize-the-search-results-table). 

By following these steps, you can efficiently explore and visualize the breadth of data associated with your molecules of interest, facilitating a deeper understanding and further analysis of your research findings. 

### Q: How do I search for data associated with a specific RA #? 
**A:**  To find data related to a specific RA# in CDD Vault, follow these steps: 

- By RA# Keyword: 

- - Navigate to the search bar. 

- - Enter the RA# identifier (e.g., RA-0001796) in the "Keywords" field. You can search with or without the batch number. 

- - Press 'Enter' or click the search button to retrieve associated data. 

- By Structure using the Editor: 

- - Go to the structure editor within CDD Vault. 

- - Draw or import the molecular structure corresponding to the RA#. 

- - Execute the structure search to locate related compounds and data sets. 

Each RA# is linked to a specific SMILES string representing the compound's structure. While the final two digits indicate the batch, the structure remains consistent across batches, differing only in source or synthesis method. For detailed instructions and additional information on customizing your search results, you can refer to this guide: [Search for Molecules by Keywords](https://support.collaborativedrug.com/hc/en-us/articles/214358443-Search-for-Molecules-by-Keywords) 

### Q: What is the “IGNORE” ID that I see associated with molecules?  
**A:** CDD autogenerated number. Please ignore it and use the READDI Batch ID as the primary ID number.  

### Q: I see data associated with my lab’s protocols and it needs to be changed/updated. 
**A:** [Contact Ava](contact_us.md) with specific Run # and concerns.

### Q: I ran a search, but I only see the IGNORE ID and I cannot see the RA #. How do I add this to my search report?  
**A:**
