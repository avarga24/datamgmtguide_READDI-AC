# READDI-AC Data Stewardship
The Data Stewardship team consists of committed project staff who provide support to researchers and study teams. The Stewards provide essential resources aimed at ensuring excellence in data management and robust support for the READDI project's researchers and investigators. A key objective of the Steward's role is to affirm that the READDI project adheres to the [FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) of data sharing. This commitment is evident in the multifaceted approach to data handling and support, addressing various aspects such as:

+ **Project and Protocol Registration Guidance:** Stewards provide essential support in navigating the project and protocol registration processes, ensuring adherence to current protocols and aiding in the seamless initiation of research activities.
+ **Provision of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Data Templating:** By supplying standardized SOPs, the stewardship group supports consistent and accurate data collection and reporting. They also assist in creating data templates that facilitate efficient data preparation and integration with CDD Vault.
+ **Assistance with Data Transformation and CDD Vault Uploads:** The stewards are instrumental in transforming raw data into CDD Vault-compatible formats, aiding with data mapping and the upload process to ensure effective data integration and accessibility.
+ **Readout and Variable Mapping Support in CDD Vault:** The group assists with crucial data mapping activities, ensuring accurate data tagging and alignment, which are essential for meaningful data analysis and interpretation.
+ **User Role Clarification and Protocol Support:** Stewards help delineate specific user role requirements and provide expert assistance for inquiries related to current protocols, fostering a clear understanding and smooth operation within the project.
